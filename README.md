## ABOUT THE INTERNSHIP
[HackBio](https://thehackbio.com/) is a virtually regimented research internship that is practice oriented and focused on equipping African scientists with advanced bioinformatics and computational biology skills. By the end of internship, successful interns should have:
- Honed their skills in a specific bioinformatics method
- Have at least a peer-reviewed article to show for the internship experience
## GOALS
1. Expand the bioinformatics capabilities of African scientists
2. Improve networking among young African scientists
3. Accelerate bioinformatics discoveries in Africa
4. Increase public understanding of biological science and its implications for our world
## HOW IT WORKS
- There are 5 rigorous and research intensive stages in the internship, Stages 0-4.
- The internship is free of cost, no entry cost, exam or interview is required. Only your commitment is required
- We expect that even a complete novice who is ready to learn-on-the-go should successfully complete the internship through active learning, collaboration and
networking.
- The internship is completely virtual,
no on-site presence is required.
- Each intern is expected to pick one
BIOSTACK while registering for the
internship. It can be changed until
stage 1 is completed.
- Open sessions with mentors and
sponsors on best practices and
research/study opportunities will be
provided from time to time
- Eliminated candidates at each stage
will be provided with some general
information on what they can do to
improve on themselves
- Mentors are quite experienced in
their fields and are to be respected
when they give instructions. They
are empowered to revoke your
status as an intern if found wanton.
- Finally, try as much as possible to
be friendly to everyone, collaborate,
network and build academic
relationships all over Africa, who
knows, your interaction can be the
next big thing in the world.
## ABOUT THE STAGES
- STAGE 0: Pruning those that are
complete novice and are not ready
to learn-on-the-go. Simple tasks (3
days)
- STAGE 1: Achieve digital
collaboration with common tools
among participants; anyone who is
unable to collaborate will be
eliminated (4 days)
- STAGE 2*: Distribution of
individuals into different biostacks,
as it applies to the theme.
Preliminary tasks on usage of
software, linux environment and
basic language debugging. (1 week;
60 persons scale through and enter
stage 2)
- STAGE 3*: Reshuffling of individuals
into 5 teams and assignment of the
5 projects. All participants who get
to this stage will receive a badge of
honor. (1 week; 40 persons scale
through and enter stage 4)
- STAGE 4: Submission of all results
in their raw form, all codes, designs
and final manuscript draft ready for
submission.
## ABOUT THE BIOSTACKS
**“BIOSTACK”** is just our fancy word for
areas of specialization and applications in
bioinformatics. They include:
- genomics
- drug development
- vaccine informatics
- medicinal chemistry
- cheminformatics
- data analytics
- software development
- science communication
- publication image design
- bioinformatics frontend/UI/UX
