## ABOUT THE INTERNSHIP
![hackbio image](https://thehackbio.com/assets3/images/5228730.jpeg)
[HackBio](https://thehackbio.com/) is a virtually regimented research internship that is practice oriented and focused on equipping African scientists with advanced bioinformatics and computational biology skills. By the end of internship, successful interns should have:
- Honed their skills in a specific bioinformatics method
- Have at least a peer-reviewed article to show for the internship experience
### GOALS
1. Expand the bioinformatics capabilities of African scientists
2. Improve networking among young African scientists
3. Accelerate bioinformatics discoveries in Africa
4. Increase public understanding of biological science and its implications for our world
### HOW IT WORKS
- There are 5 rigorous and research intensive stages in the internship, Stages 0-4.
- The internship is free of cost, no entry cost, exam or interview is required. Only your commitment is required
- We expect that even a complete novice who is ready to learn-on-the-go should successfully complete the internship through active learning, collaboration and
networking.
- The internship is completely virtual,
no on-site presence is required.
- Each intern is expected to pick one
BIOSTACK while registering for the
internship. It can be changed until
stage 1 is completed.
- Open sessions with mentors and
sponsors on best practices and
research/study opportunities will be
provided from time to time
- Eliminated candidates at each stage
will be provided with some general
information on what they can do to
improve on themselves
- Mentors are quite experienced in
their fields and are to be respected
when they give instructions. They
are empowered to revoke your
status as an intern if found wanton.
- Finally, try as much as possible to
be friendly to everyone, collaborate,
network and build academic
relationships all over Africa, who
knows, your interaction can be the
next big thing in the world.
### ABOUT THE STAGES
- STAGE 0: Pruning those that are
complete novice and are not ready
to learn-on-the-go. Simple tasks (3
days)
- STAGE 1: Achieve digital
collaboration with common tools
among participants; anyone who is
unable to collaborate will be
eliminated (4 days)
- STAGE 2*: Distribution of
individuals into different biostacks,
as it applies to the theme.
Preliminary tasks on usage of
software, linux environment and
basic language debugging. (1 week;
60 persons scale through and enter
stage 2)
- STAGE 3*: Reshuffling of individuals
into 5 teams and assignment of the
5 projects. All participants who get
to this stage will receive a badge of
honor. (1 week; 40 persons scale
through and enter stage 4)
- STAGE 4: Submission of all results
in their raw form, all codes, designs
and final manuscript draft ready for
submission.
### ABOUT THE BIOSTACKS
**“BIOSTACK”** is just our fancy word for
areas of specialization and applications in
bioinformatics. They include:
- genomics
- drug development
- vaccine informatics
- medicinal chemistry
- cheminformatics
- data analytics
- software development
- science communication
- publication image design
- bioinformatics frontend/UI/UX

### LIST OF COLLABORATION TOOLS
- _**Slack**_
- _GitHub_
- _Google Account_
- Figma
- _**R cloud**_
- Cloud Computing resources
- Jupyter cloud
- _**UNIX environment (Putty for windows)**_

>**Bold**: Must be installed locally on your PC  ||  
>Green/_italicized_: No installation, just an account.



### USING OUR SLACK WORKSPACE
A 30 minutes onboarding call will be
provided on how to use the workspace.
However, if for anything, you forget the
instructions, kindly refer to this guide:
1. Use a simple but unique username
on the workspace throughout the
internship
2. Do not abuse anyone in any form.
Respect is the keyword here.
3. Share only materials that you are
sure have open access licenses
4. Update your tag as soon as you are
promoted to the next stage.
5. We strongly discourage the use of
any messenger platform apart from
slack. Virtually all you need is available on slack (chat, private
channel, storage, emojis, polls,
threads). We are not responsible for
any abuse or insult that may arise
from any external platform

### ABOUT OUR SLACK CHANNELS
- #hackbio-office: Company-wide
announcements and work-based
matters
- #introduction: Introduce yourself
here, make new friends, naturally,
do not abuse anyone. Keep it official
- #random: Non-work banter and
water cooler conversation
- #resources: Inspire someone, help
someone, share something
- #journal-club: Use /pubmed and
discuss recent articles in your field
- #bode-thomas: The only road that
leads you home (Inspired by Master
KG's Skeleton Move; South Africa).
You don't want to be here.

## About The Team
Team Berg is a diverse group of individual with the sole aim to learn a skills in bioinformatics and computational biology regardless of her nationality.  A team ranging from students, researchers and computer scientist, software engineers and molecular professionals will no doubt complish more. And this is what we bring to the table always  below is a task the team set out to accomplish.

## The Task

1. Each team should create a GitHub repo.
2. Add a comprehensive readme.md with essential information about the internship, the team, the contributors, pictures if possible using markdown.
3. Each team will work on a minimum of 7 different programming languages
4. For each person in a team, pick one of the 7 programming languages. Write a script that prints your name, your email, your slack username (with @) , your biostack, your twitter handle and hamming distance in that order. 
5. The output for every team member should now be name, email, slack_username (with @) your biostack , twitter_handle and hamming_distance .
6. Push the script to your team's git repo
7. Collaboratively as a team, develop a bash script that clones the git repo, and generates a CSV file from all the outputs of your team's scripts
8. Submit your team's GitHub link to only the bash script
9. Only the emails and slack handles that are on the CSV sheet generated by your script will be promoted to stage 1
